Qeyo's Red-Ops Arsenal

"The best defense is a proactive, unyielding offense. To build a fortress, you must first learn to tear one down."
****

My journey through the Crimson Trace roadmap‚Äîa methodical, forceful shift from a senior IT and cybersecurity professional to a top ethical hacker with expertise in penetration testing, red teaming, and digital forensics‚Äîis centered around this repository.

**Mission & Objectives**

Mission: To become an expert in offensive security, not just as a practitioner but also as a leader, innovator, and mentor. The "Adwa Vanguard" project aims to use this knowledge to build and train the next generation of African cyber defenders.

**Core Objectives:**

* Penetration Testing: Systematically identify and exploit vulnerabilities across network, web, and cloud infrastructures.

* Red Teaming: Test and improve an organization's ability to handle advanced persistent threats (APTs) from a broad point of view.

* Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR): Master the art of tracing adversarial activity, understanding the "shadow" of an attack to become a more effective operator.

* Community & Mentorship: Create a place where people can work together to share knowledge and improve their skills.

**The Arsenal: Tools & Technologies**

This is a list of the main tools that are being used and improved during this mission.

**Lab Walkthroughs & Research**

There are detailed write-ups and analyses of my hands-on lab work in this section. Each entry talks about the method, the main things learned, and how to fix things.* /walkthroughs/hack-the-box/
* /walkthroughs/tryhackme/
* /research/exploit-development/

(Note: These directories will be populated as I progress through the roadmap.)

ü§ù **Contributions & Collaboration**

This mission is not a solo endeavor. Growth is accelerated through community.

Please feel free to open an Issue or send a Pull Request if you see a mistake, have an idea for how to make a script better, or want to talk about a certain technique. Any helpful feedback is welcome.

Let's build something formidable together.
